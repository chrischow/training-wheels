# Training Wheels
This repository contains the code and notes for courses on various technologies.

## Learning Plan

1. **[Node.js](./nodejs/):** This is arguably one of the most important backend technologies of our time. Many companies are using Node.js as part of their stack because of a great balance between performance and industry popularity. Although there are newer and more performant technologies like [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) coming up, they are probably easier to learn with a strong foundation in Node.js.
2. **Django:** This is arguably the most popular and battle-tested batteries-included framework for enterprise apps. As apps scale, dev teams may want to trade flexibility for consistency by using an opinionated framework like Django to align developers on a common set of coding practices.
3. **FastAPI:** This is the Python equivalent of Node.js, and is one of the most performant frameworks in Python, certainly more than Django. It is rapidly gaining popularity.
